## What is K1s Terminal?

K1s Terminal is a powerful, user-friendly interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It's built with modern technologies like React and TypeScript, and it's designed to be easy to use whether you're a Kubernetes novice or an experienced cluster administrator.

## Features

* **Simplified Kubernetes Management**: K1s Terminal simplifies the process of managing Kubernetes clusters. It provides a clean, intuitive interface that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and monitor your applications, for new and experienced users alike. Our vision is to democratize Kubernetes, making it accessible and easy to use for everyone.

* **Multi Environment**: K1s Terminal integrates seamlessly with multiple Kubernetes clusters, allowing you to manage your resources from a single interface. This makes it easy to switch between clusters and manage your applications without having to switch between different tools.

* **Interface for Kubernetes user's better Experience**: We introduced a new way to interact with Kubernetes resources. The K1s Terminal provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate through your resources, with color-coded and interactive output for the kubectl get pods command. You can click on a pod in the output to see its details, and navigate through namespaces and nodes with ease.

Enjoy what we call the **KX (Kubernetes Experience)** with K1s Terminal, the UX (User Experience) and DX (Developer Experience) for Kubernetes users.
