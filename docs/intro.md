# Quick Start to get Kubernetes in 1 Second

K1s is a platform designed to make Kubernetes and cloud-native tools accessible to developers of all experience levels. It eliminates the complexities of setup and configuration, offering a serverless Kubernetes cluster and an intelligent terminal integrated with Kubernetes and cloud-native tools.

## What is K1s?

- **[K1s Serverless](./k1s-serverless) Cluster** â€“ Instantly spin up a Kubernetes environment without installation or configuration hassles. K1sS is a simulated Kubernetes clusterâ€”accessible via a public API endpointâ€” that allows you to explore Kubernetes features and resources effortlessly.

- **K1s [QBot](./qbot)** â€“ An AI-powered assistant built powered with Agentic AI on Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance Kubernetes and cloud-native development without replacing human expertise, but rather augmenting it.

## Why Use K1s?

- **Zero Setup:** No complex installation - just start using Kubernetes instantly!
- **Enhanced Productivity:** A seamless CLI experience optimized for DevOps workflows.
- **AI Assistance:** QBot helps you maximize Kubernetes efficiency through AI-powered insights.
- **Community-Driven:** Currently in Technical Preview, with no authentication required - your feedback shapes the future of K1s.
