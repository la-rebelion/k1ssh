# QBot: smart Kubepilot

QBot is designed to simplify Kubernetes operations in air-gapped environments, making DevOps smarter, faster, and more efficient. It enables you to:

- **Scaffold New Microservices** – Quickly set up new projects with best practices built-in. Use our AI Tools to generate boilerplate code and configurations. [`init-project`](https://agentico.dev/tools/@k1ssh/qbot-init-project/) tool is available to scaffold a new project with a directory structure and configuration files aligned with a `helm` Chart and Kubernetes `kustomize` setup.
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks** – Reduce manual effort and streamline workflows.
- **Seamlessly Interact with Kubernetes** – Use the QBot CLI or AI Agent for intelligent cluster management.

With QBot, you can automate the mundane and focus on what truly matters—your code and your business
